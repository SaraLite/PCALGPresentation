    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Computational weight:} The computation step of calculation of posterior probabilities  takes time $O(m^2L^2)$, where m is the number of sequences and L is the length of each sequence.
        \item \textbf{M-Coffe (Meta-Coffe):} combines the output of 15 different sequence alignment methods(ProbCons included). M-Coffe employs a consistency-based approach to estimate a more accurate consensus alignment. 
        \item \textbf{Structural methods:} adding structural information, even further accuracy is achieved.
